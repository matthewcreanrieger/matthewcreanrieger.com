				<h1>Accessibility Awareness Campaign</h1>
				<p>The video "A Day In The Life: Accessibility At Miami University" was created for an introductory course to disability studies. The assignment was to creatively raise awareness for any issue pertaining to disabilities in Oxford, Ohio.<br><br>The goal of "A Day In The Life" was to share firsthand accounts from the disabled community about their experiences on campus. Rachel, who is featured in the video, was approached about the project and was excited for the opportunity to shed a light on the struggles students with disabilities face every day. Unfortunately, the mistake was made to use a GoPro for filming, which required many hours of subtitling and audio mixing to salvage the poor audio recording.<br><br>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmYcbdihLSA" target="_blank">YouTube upload</a> of this video has reached over 1,500 people. It is unfortunate that the video was affected by poor audio quality, but the project was successful in raising awareness about an important issue that is often overlooked in most cities around the world.</p>
