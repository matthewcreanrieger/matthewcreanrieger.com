			<h1>Accessibility Awareness Campaign</h1>
			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>During the fall semester of 2015, I took an introductory course to disability studies. For our final project, students were split into groups and were tasked with raising awareness for any issue pertaining to disabilities in Oxford, Ohio.</p>
			<h4>A Day In The Life</h4>
			<p>Many students opted for social media campaigns, but I wanted to hear firsthand from the disabled community at Miami University about their experiences living on campus. Rachel, who is featured in the video my group created, is someone I knew from a club on campus. I decided to approach her to see if she would be interested in creating a video that showcased the struggles she faced each day with accessibility on the campus. My group made a big mistake of using a GoPro to film, which resulted in horrendous audio quality, but I spent many hours subtitling the video and was able to salvage some of the audio through GarageBand's mixing tools. The video can be viewed on this webpage or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmYcbdihLSA" target="_blank">on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<p>I received an A+ for my work in this class and my professor expressed that we should be proud of the work we did for the video. The upload on my YouTube channel has reached over 1,500 people, which was more than I ever could have expected especially considering the moderate size of Miami University. I am happy that I was able to spread awareness about this important topic, but I regret that the video was harmed so much by the poor audio.</p>
