				<h1>Welcome!</h1>
				<p>My name is Matthew Rieger and I am a recent graduate from Miami University. Welcome to my website!<br><br>To view work samples from my internships, client projects, and college courses, please visit the <a href="/experience">Experience</a> tab. To view my personal projects and interests, please visit the <a href="/etc">Etc.</a> tab.<br><br>I built this website not only to showcase my professional experience, but also as a portfolio piece in and of itself. I opted to build the site from scratch - rather than to use a website builder - in order to demonstrate my ability to self-teach new skills and my high-level understanding of web development. I am not a graphic designer nor a professional developer, but everything in this website reflects my original work. All of the code for this site can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/matthewcreanrieger/portfolio/tree/gh-pages" target="_blank">my GitHub profile</a></p>
