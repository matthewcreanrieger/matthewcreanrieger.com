				<h1>Hi!</h1>
				<p>My name is Matthew Rieger and I am a recent graduate from Miami University. Welcome to my website!<br><br>To view work samples from my internships, client projects, and classes, please visit the <a href="/experience">Experience</a> tab. To view my personal projects and interests, please visit the <a href="/etc">Etc.</a> tab.<br><br>I built this website not only to showcase my professional experience, but also as a portfolio piece in and of itself. I opted to build the site from scratch - rather than using a website builder - in order to demonstrate my understanding of web development and my ability to self-teach new skills. While I am by no means a graphic designer or professional developer, everything in this website reflects my original work.</p>
