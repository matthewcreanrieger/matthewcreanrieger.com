			<h1>Digital Brand Strategy for <a href="http://www.mirrorsedge.com" target="_blank">EA's Mirror's Edge</a></h1>
			<h4>What is Mirror's Edge?</h4>
			<p>Mirror's Edge is an action-adventure platform game that tells the story of a dystopian world in which a totalitarian control has been placed on information and communication. The player takes on the role of a "runner" named Faith, who acts as a courier of private documents and information and utilizes parkour to avoid capture by the authorities. An overview of the project can be viewed <a href="assets/pdf/mirrorsedge-overview.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
			</p>
			<h4>The Project</h4>
			<p>Throughout the semester, my task was to develop the digital branding strategy for a brand of my choosing. This included an <a href="assets/pdf/mirrorsedge-community.pdf" target="_blank">online branded community assessment</a>, a <a href="assets/pdf/mirrorsedge-realtime.pdf" target="_blank">real-time marketing analysis</a>, a <a href="assets/pdf/mirrorsedge-social.pdf" target="_blank">social influence analysis</a>, a <a href="assets/pdf/mirrorsedge-voice.pdf" target="_blank">social media tone and voice analysis</a>, and ultimately a <a href="assets/pdf/mirrorsedge-brief.pdf" target="_blank">digital creative strategy brief</a>. The video associated with that brief can be viewed on this webpage or <a href="https://youtu.be/Kr8TFIoERCA" target="_blank">on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<p>I received an A+ for my work in this class and my professor consistently expressed excited about my submissions for this project, referring to my <a href="assets/pdf/mirrorsedge-brief.pdf" target="_blank">strategy brief</a> as "just excellent". The semester as a whole taught me about the many aspects involved in digital branding. Because the world is growing increasingly interconnected, it is important for brands to connect with their fans and followers in new and creative ways. Brands are extensions of their followers and digital branding needs to be extremely multifaceted in order to keep pace with ever-changing consumer preferences and needs.</p>
