			<h1>Go-To-Market Client Presentation</a></h1>
			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>This presentation was part of a Consumer Behavior marketing course I took in fall, 2015. The client was <a href="http://www.tagstudio.com/about/" target="_blank">TAG</a>, a high-end, hydrotherapy foot shower designer. The charge from the client was to provide a sustainable go-to-market strategy for their product.</p>
			<h4>Differentiation Through Research</h4>
			<p>What differentiated my group's approach was our target consumer. After conducting our research, we realized that the best route to take for the product would be to sell to industry wholesalers. To do so, we would have to get the TAG name out there through trade shows and testimonials. Additionally, my group made the unique choice to provide data from <a href="https://usabilityhub.com" target="_blank">Usability Hub</a> to determine which of two existing TAG logos was preferred. For this project, I took on the responsibilities of presenting, formatting deliverables, and writing half of the <a href="assets/pdf/tag-appendix.pdf" target="_blank">appendix</a>. The full presentation can be viewed <a href="assets/pdf/tag.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<p>Our group was the only group to pitch a B2B sales approach. I received an A for my work in the course and my group was commended by the client for our unique approach to the problem.</p>
