				<h1>Floragraph: Marketing Capstone</h1>
				<p>The group assignment was to develop a go-to-market strategy for Floragraph, an in-home, gut microbiome sequencing tool. This project was part of Miami University's <a href="http://miamioh.edu/cca/digital-innovation/about/index.html" target="_blank">San Francisco Digital Innovation</a> co-op program.<br><br>Ultimately, a <a href="assets/pdf/floragraph-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">go-to-market presentation</a>, logo, <a href="assets/pic/floragraph-ad.jpg" target="_blank">ad mockup</a>, <a href="assets/pdf/floragraph-pitch-deck.pdf" target="_blank">pitch deck</a>, and <a href="floragraph/index.html" target="_blank">website</a> were created. My work included designing and compiling the pitch deck and final presentation as well as presenting at the capstone's end-of-year event.<br><br>The client especially appreciated the pitch deck for investors and was impressed with the broad scope of work completed.</p>
