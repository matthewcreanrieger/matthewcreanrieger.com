			<h1>Marketing Capstone for <a href="http://www.floragraph.me">Floragraph</a></h1>
			<h4>What is Floragraph?</h4>
			<p>Floragraph is a in-home, gut microbiome sequencing tool that provides personal microbiome profiling based near San Francisco, California. Floragraph was the client for the capstone course I took in the fall semester of 2016 as part of a study away <a href="http://miamioh.edu/cca/digital-innovation/about/index.html" target="_blank">San Francisco Digital Innovation co-op program</a>. Students were interviewed and selected for the program. Each student worked Mondays through Thursdays at a Bay Area startup and spent Fridays visiting companies all throughout the peninsula as part of the program. A few of the companies we visited included Google, Softbank Robotics, and Barracuda.</p>
			<h4>Our Team's Work</h4>
			<p>By the end of the semester, my cohort had created a comprehensive <a href="assets/pdf/floragraph-presentation.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a> that included a go-to-market strategy, a logo, <a href="assets/pic/floragraph-ad.jpg" target="_blank">advertisement placements</a>, a <a href="assets/pdf/floragraph-pitch-deck.pdf" target="_blank">pitch deck</a>, and a <a href="floragraph/index.html" target="_blank">website</a>. My work included designing and compiling the pitch deck and final presentation as well as presenting for the client at the capstone's end-of-year event.</p>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<p>This project taught me a lot about juggling responsibilities and handling many moving parts. There were 20 students in the cohort and everyone had various, complex schedules to work around. Because each student worked four days a week, it was tough to gather team members to accomplish tasks. I learned how to lead through action on this project and I believe that my contributions were a major reason for the capstone's overall success.</p>
