				<h1>Fictional Product Launch Competition</a></h1>
				<h4>Background</h4>
				<p>The assignment was to pitch a new product line that appealed to one of three assigned minority target markets: Hispanic and Latino American, black Americans, and LGBT Americans. The winning group from each of these three targets then proceeded to a department-wide "shark tank" event, which was held in an auditorium with guest judges from Cincinnati. Our group was selected from the Hispanic and Latino American sub-demographic as a finalist for the competition.</p>
				<h4>Coffee Cabeza</h4>
				<p>Our group's idea was a line of coffee products inspired by the artwork, political climate, and distinct flavor profiles found along the coffee belt in Central America. The countries we chose to base our three lines of beans on were Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. By associating our products with humanitarian and politcal issues, we sought to capture the educated and activist millennial demographic. The packaging design was based on art styles historically found in those three countries. I was responsible for creating the presentation, presenting, and designing the products. You can view the full presentation <a href="assets/pdf/sharktank.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
				<h4>Result</h4>
				<p>Our group ultimately won the shark tank competition. We were commended for talking directly to our target market and for drawing inspiration from the historic art styles of the three countries we sampled. The project was a great experience because it forced me to market to a demographic with which I am not familiar. I had to consider the product from an entirely different perspective than my own, which is crucial for any new product development process.</p>
