				<h1>Coffee Cabeza</a></h1>
				<p>The assignment was to pitch a new product line that appealed to one of three assigned minority target markets: Hispanic/Latino Americans, black Americans, or LGBT Americans. After an initial class presentation, the Coffee Cabeza group was chosen as a finalist for a department-wide "shark tank" event, which was held in an auditorium with guest judges from Cincinnati.<br><br>Coffee Cabeza was a line of coffee products inspired by the artwork, political climate, and distinct flavor profiles found along the coffee belt in Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The packaging promoted humanitarian and political activism in order to attract a millennial demographic and was based on art styles historically found in these three countries. My work included creating the <a href="assets/pdf/sharktank.pdf" target="_blank">presentation</a>, presenting, and designing the packaging.<br><br>Coffee Cabeza was the first place winner at the competition and the pitch was commended for its target market research as well as for the incorporation of historic art styles in the packaging.</p>
