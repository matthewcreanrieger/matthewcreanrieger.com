				<h1>The Marketing Store Internship</h1>
				<p>The Marketing Store Worldwide is a global customer engagement agency. The position at their Chicago office was a Digital Production Intern, filling what was essentially a quality assurance role.<br><br>Experiences ranged from office projects - like organizing Bring Your Kids To Work day - to client work, such as the McDonald's Money Monopoly Canada program. The T-Mobile Tuesdays app was one such client project and launched in early June, 2016. Responsibilities included testing app updates daily and reporting bugs, often formulating unusual use cases in order to "break" the app.<br><br>The app was a huge success that gained <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/free-pizza-stock-work-their-magic-as-customers-flock-to-t-mobile/" target="_blank">national media attention</a>, though it was not without its fair share of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/t-mobile-thanks-customers-with-a-new-freebies-app-that-hasnt-worked-all-day/" target="_blank">hiccups</a>. It can be said that if a product launches without bugs, it launched too late. Projects like T-Mobile Tuesdays were experiences in prioritizing and striking a balance between perfection and timeliness. </p>
