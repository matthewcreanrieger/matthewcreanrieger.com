			<h1>Digital Production Internship at <a href="http://www.tmsw.com" target="_blank">The Marketing Store</a></h1>
			<h4>What is The Marketing Store?</h4>
			<p>The Marketing Store Worldwide is an integrated brand activation agency specialising in retail and FMCG. TMSW has offices around the globe and my internship was during the summer of 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. I was hired as a Digital Production Intern, which was essentially a quality assurance position.</p>
			<h4>T-Mobile Tuesdays</h4>
			<p>Throughout the summer, I worked on a number of projects, ranging from McDonald's Monopoly Canada to organizing Bring Your Kids to Work Day. T-Mobile Tuesdays, however, was definitely the most exciting project. It launched in June and I was a part of the team testing it each day and reporting bugs. I am a gamer at heart, so I thoroughly enjoyed digging through the app and trying to create the most ridiculous use-cases in order to "break" the app.</p>
			<h4>What I Learned</h4>
			<p>This project taught me about the importance of being able to balance between launching a product on time and launching a product bug-free. If any product launches without bugs, it launched too late. However, striking a balance is tricky and requires strong leadership to make a decision and manage fires as they arise. I learned a lot from being in the center of such a hectic app launch and am proud to say that there is a trace of my work present in the T-Mobile Tuesdays app.</p>
