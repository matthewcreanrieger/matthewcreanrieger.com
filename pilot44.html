			<h1>Digital Innovation Co-Op at <a href="http://www.pilot44.com">Pilot44</a></h1>
			<h4>What is Pilot44?</h4>
			<p>Pilot44 is a digital innovation outpost that accelerates the innovation strategies of corporations by introducing them to and conducting pilot programs with startups and new tech from around the globe. The internship took place during the fall semester of 2016 and was in conjunction to my school's <a href="floragraph.html">San Francisco Digital Innovation Co-Op</a> program.</p>
			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>I was initially hired into an operations management role, but I constantly inserted myself into projects and took on various initiatives because I wanted to be client-facing. I ran errands, completed research assignments, scouted Bay Area expos & conventions, and took on event planning roles for Pilot44 innovation courses. By the end of my internship, I was both creating and leading presentations for major clients.</p>
			<h4>Presenting For International Clients</h4>
			<p>This was my first experience presenting for clients outside of an academic setting. I love to present, though, and I enjoyed each interaction I had with clients at Pilot44. Three examples of presentations I created are a CPG Investment Insights presentation for multi-billion dollar client, a flash research presentation for an international client preparing for a large investment, and a BotDay convention recap for the Pilot44 team.</p>
			<h4>What I Learned</h4>
			<p>My coworkers and I shared a lot of great memories and I made an effort each day to help out around the office. I led group lunches each week, decorated the office, and even organized a bowling outing for the entire team and a corporate client. I received multiple compliments from my coworkers at the end of my internship for my time there. I think the biggest skill I developed throughout the semester was networking. I made a lot of networking mistakes at the events & expos I attended, but learned from them and became more confident as a result.</p>
