			<h4>What is Pilot44?</h4>
			<p>Pilot44 is a digital innovation outpost that accelerates the innovation strategies of corporations. My internship took place during the 2016 fall semester and was in conjunction with Miami University's <a href="floragraph.html">San Francisco Digital Innovation Co-Op</a> program.</p>
			<h4>My Role</h4>
			<p>I was initially hired into an operations management role. By the end of my internship, I was both creating and leading presentations for major clients. Additionally, I helped organize events and manage client relationships. My internship was unique because my role evolved to fit whatever need Pilot44 had.</p>
			<h4>Contributions</h4>
			<p>Three examples of presentations I created are a CPG Investment Insights presentation for multi-billion dollar company, a flash research presentation to prepare an international client for a large investment, and a BotDay convention recap for the Pilot44 team.</p>
