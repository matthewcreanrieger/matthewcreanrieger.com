			<h1>Entrepreneurship Capstone for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lucky-7-Distillery-1464993993802730/" target="_blank">Lucky 7 Distillery</a></h1>
			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>The capstone was a 14-week consulting project in fall of 2015 for Lucky 7 Distillery, a startup in Batesville, Indiana that was preparing to release their first product line: Blackhorse Bourbon.</p>
			<h4>Building A Brand</h4>
			<p>Throughout the semester, my team developed branding strategies, marketing strategies, go-to-market events and activities, a financial analysis, and a promotional video for the launch of Blackhorse Bourbon. Brand development was not requested by the client, but ultimately served to be the most crucial element of the presentation and was what ultimately impressed the clients the most. I was chiefly responsible for formatting <a href="assets/pdf/lucky7.pdf" target="_blank">the PowerPoint</a>, presenting, creating the branding strategies, and creating the promotional video, which can be viewed on this webpage or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLCQz74NIGs" target="_blank">on my YouTube channel</a>.</p>
			<h4>Result</h4>
			<p>I received an A+ for my work in this class and I have a <a href="assets/pdf/rec.pdf" target="_blank">letter of recommendation</a> from my professor commending me for my work on the project. My group for this project was incredible and the overall experience was one of the best I had in college. Working with this client was an invaluable learning experience, as well. I gained a better understanding of the struggles associated with starting a new business and I also learned a lot about what goes into launching a new product. I still keep in touch with the founders of the distillery and was offered last year to work as a part-time freelance video content creator.</p>
