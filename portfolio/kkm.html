			<h4>What is Kanji And Kana Master?</h4>
			<p>Kanji And Kana Master is a matching game that enables players to study Japanese on-the-go. What differentiates Kanji And Kana Master from other Japanese apps is that it includes all 2,136 common-use Kanji characters. The app is straightforward, free to download, customizable, and - most importantly - is fun to play.</p>
			<h4>Context</h4>
			<p>Kanji And Kana Master resulted from the application of gamification principles to my own personal learning endeavor. I began studying Japanese after becoming close friends with a group of Japanese exchange students. When I visited them over the summer, I needed a fun and rewarding way to continue my studies without the hassle of relying on the internet or carrying books. Thus, Kanji And Kana Master was born.</p>
			<h4>Building An App</h4>
			<p>The only coding experience I had prior to this project was introductory Java courses. I taught myself C#, Unity, and Xcode in order to create Kanji And Kana Master. After version 1.0 was complete, I spent the next year determining improvements and expanding upon the app's features. I wanted my app to be a gamer's game. I also learned how to integrate analytics within my app to uncover patterns in user behavior.</p>
			<h4>Kanji And Kana Master Today</h4>
			<p>Today, in spite of no real marketing efforts, Kanji And Kana Master has over 1,500 downloads and 250 active users. The app's fully integrated analytics system enables me to analyze user interaction and shape future iterations. From this experience, I have learned about coding, app development, time management, user interface design, user experience design, and the trials and tribulations associated with bringing a labor of love to market.</p>
