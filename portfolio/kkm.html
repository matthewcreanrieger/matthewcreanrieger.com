			<h4>What is Kanji And Kana Master?</h4>
			<p>Kanji And Kana Master, at it's core, is a matching game. I took the principles of gamification that I had learned at school and applied it to my own learning endeavor. What differentiates Kanji And Kana Master from other Japanese apps is that it includes all 2,136 common-use Kanji characters. The app is simple, straightforward, free to download, and - most importantly - fun to play.</p>
			<h4>Context</h4>
			<p>I began studying Japanese during my sophomore year of college after becoming close friends with a number of exchange students from Osaka, Tokyo, and Nagoya. In order to visit them after their exchange programs ended, I decided to plan a trip to Japan. While abroad, I wanted a way to continue my studies of the over 2,000 Japanese Kanji characters in a way that was fun and easy without the hassle of carrying around a book. Thus, the idea for Kanji And Kana Master was born.</p>
			<h4>Building An App</h4>
			<p>The only coding experience I had prior to this project was with introductory Java courses. Throughout the next few months, I taught myself C#, Unity, and Xcode in order to create Kanji And Kana Master. After my version 1.0 was complete, I spent the next year determining what changes I wanted to make and expanding upon the features of the app. I also learned how to integrate analytics in order to uncover patterns in user interaction with Kanji And Kana Master.</p>
			<h4>Kanji And Kana Master Today</h4>
			<p>Today, in spite of no real marketing efforts, Kanji And Kana Master has over 1,500 downloads and 250 active users. The app also has fully integrated analytics that enable me to analyze user interaction with the app. This data will help me shape the next iterations of the app. From this experience, I have learned about coding, app development, time management, user interface design, user experience design, and the trials and tribulations associated with bringing a labor of love to market.</p>
